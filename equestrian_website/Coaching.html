	<h1>Training With Colm</h1>
	<p>Colm started his competitive riding career at sixteen years old in jumping. He continued to compete in jumping up until 		he was twenty-four years old at which point he started his dressage career. He’s currently competing at Advanced 		Medium with his two horses and hopes to school them both up to Advanced very soon!</p>
		<p>Colm teaches a wide range of clients, from young to old all with mixed abilities. <br />

He always takes his time to teach me and is always looking for ways to improve my riding. Colm has taught me jumping and flatwork. Buttons and I have come on so much since our first lesson with Colm and I can only see us geting better together with his help."</em><br />Rachel Ring</div>
