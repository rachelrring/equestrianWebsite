	<h1>All About Us!</h1>
	<p>Colm started out riding when he was just eight years old, when he quickly developed a love for the sport. The reason Colm set up his own livery yard is because he wanted to create an environment in which horses could be given the best care, love and attention they deserve. He has owned and ran his own livery yard now for four years, because he loves working with horses and building good relationships with his clients. </p>
